However, in the displayed ACL 3099, there are multiple permit rules before the final deny ip rule, and the deny rule has been matched over 500,000 times. This indicates that a large amount of traffic is still being denied after the permit rules, meaning the isolation is not properly restricted — traffic that should be blocked is being allowed due to overly permissive permit rules before the deny.
